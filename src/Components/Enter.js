          The first thing you see in Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite,” a thriller of
          extraordinary cunning and emotional force, is an upper window in a
          tiny underground apartment. From this high, narrow vantage the Kims, a
          resilient family of four, living in a grubby Seoul street strewn with
          garbage bags and electrical wires. Sometime later the Kim's will stand
          before a much larger window, as big and beautiful as a cinema screen,
          in an enormous house with a gorgeous sunlit garden. It’s not just a
          different view; it’s a different world. Through the brilliant and
          deeply unsettling “Parasite. The story takes place in South Korea but
          could easily unfold in Los Angeles or London perhaps even in India.
          High school graduate Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik) and his sister, Ki-jung
          (Park So Dam) exhibit the close bonds between brother and sister, as
          well as the easy rapport they share with their boisterous father,
          Ki-taek (Song Kang Ho), and sharp-witted mother, Chung-sook (Chang
          Hyae Jin). Living together in close quarters has bred in them a
          matter-of-fact intimacy and a wily self-sufficiency But the movie
          swiftly establishes its own unpredictable agenda not long after Ki-woo
          inherits an English tutoring job from a college-student friend (Park
          Seo Joon). Thus the Kim's Establishment with The Parks begin, whose
          lives of extravagant luxury represent the real moral and financial
          scourge in a ruthless late-capitalist society.The Kims enjoy their
          sudden boost in income, but their ambitions — and the dramatic stakes
          — only escalate from there. I wouldn’t dream of disclosing the
          stunning, multilayered surprises that await you in “Parasite,” though
          it gives away nothing to note that it’s about two families on warring
          sides of the class divide. As this allegory of class rage plays out,
          you may find yourself wondering about the exact meaning of the movie’s
          title. At first it seems the parasites must be the lowly Kims, who are
          so interdependent that they often seem less like individuals than
          members of a single, unified organism. (Watch the way they sometimes
          squat and crawl around in private, like stealthy four-legged insects —
          or perhaps just people accustomed to low ceilings.) But then, surely
          the title more truthfully describes the Parks, whose lives of
          extravagant luxury represent the real moral and financial scourge in a
          ruthless late-capitalist society. The first hour or so of “Parasite”
          is simply the most dazzling movie about the joys of the con I’ve seen
          in years slowly shifting to a heist thriller. What distinguishes is
          “Parasite” begins in exhilaration and ends in devastation, but the
          triumph of the movie is that it fully lives and breathes at every
          moment, even when you might find yourself struggling to exhale.
