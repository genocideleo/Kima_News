          Over 3 years after Zothansanga was allegedly sexually assaulted by
          Zodinliana Sailo, grandson of two-time former state chief minister T
          Sailo, justice continues to elude the 27-year-old youth from Aizawl.
          An online petition which was started in 2018 is being circulated on
          the web via Twitter and other social media platforms, demanding
          justice of Zothansanga. The petition states that there have not been
          any satisfactory reports, investigation, proceedings or action taken
          regarding the reported atrocity committed on Zothansanga on 7th
          September 2018. Petitioners fear that the people have forgotten about
          the case and authorities have taken advantage of the same, sweeping
          the issue under the rug. The online petition “It is in the interest of
          the people that the voices of those who had been trampled upon be
          heard, empathised, consoled, and reciprocated with justice,” reads the
          petition on change.org. The petition was started by someone by the
          name of Alkaianti Nom-de-plume and was an appeal to District Court
          (Aizawl District Court), Balaji Srivastava IPS, DGP, Joseph Lalchhuana
          Deputy Inspector General of Police, Lalbiakthanga Khiangte IPS DIG
          (NR), Aizawl, Sh. Zosangliana MPSSP CID (Crime), Sh. C. Lalzahngoa
          MPSSP Aizawl District, Smt. A. Mathumma IASDeputy Commissioner,
          Aizawl, Sh. Neihchungnunga IPSDIG (CID) and Justice H.L.
          DattuChairperson, NHRC. It has been signed by over 63 thousand people
          and needs to be signed by at least 75 thousand people for it to rank
          as a top petition on the portal. “We do not wish that our strive for
          justice be muffled by lack of compliance, incompetence, influence, or
          bias. We do not wish for mob justice, but justice served in the
          confines of the law,” the petition read further with petitioners loud
          and clear about their yearning for justice in the case. “Equal rights
          between rich and poor, I want zothansanga to have the right to Justice
          and give the criminal the way to his punishment he deserves,” says
          Febbi Hmar, a petitioners who signed the petition. “Justice needs to
          be served, wether it’s against the richest or the most influential. No
          one should be denied their right to justice,” says another petitioner
          Leon Guite. “I detest such a cruel deed as this whole-heartedly! Let
          justice reign our lives,” wrote another supporter Jerome Sailo. “I
          have heard the story and I just want justice be shown. I don’t know
          the two parties but I know what is right,” opined Zorama Chawngthu.
          The petitioners had handed out 4×6 inch stickers with “Justice for
          Zothansanga” printed on them at Zarkawt. The stickers could be pasted
          on vehicles or surfaces to draw people’s attention, said another 2018
          update of on the website. Over 3 years after Zothansanga was allegedly
